# iSarcasm-SemEval-2022-Task-6
iSarcasmEval: Intended Sarcasm Detection In English and Arabic

## Files

We included the models of final submissions in the subtask along with the corresponding datasets. We splitted the official training datasets into "train" and "validation" splits and we used the offical testing datasets for reporting the results. In the files you can find five folders corresponding to five subtasks. Each folder contains the following:

- Training dataset which is based on the "train" split and augmented by external data or by repeating instances.
- Validation dataset which is the "validation" split.
- Tesing dataset which is the official testing dataset.
- Python notebook including the model of the final submission.

All the datasets are processed with the same type of preprocessing.
